# Load training data
Read training data, find number of missing points for each variable, remove missing points.
```{r}
train_f <- "training.csv"
train <- read.csv(train_f)
train_no_na <- data.frame(train)
features <- colnames(train)
n_ina <- vector("integer", length = length(features))
for (feature in seq_along(features)) {
    ina <- train[, feature] == -999.0
    n_ina[feature] <- sum(ina)
}
for (feature in seq_along(features)) {
    ina <- train_no_na[, feature] == -999.0
    train_no_na <- train_no_na[!ina, ]
}
```

# Print simple summary on pure variables
```{r}
summary(train_no_na)
